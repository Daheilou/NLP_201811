a=(b+c)∗(c+2)

This may seem like a silly example – but notice a powerful idea in expressing the equation this way: **two of the computations (d=b+c and e=c+2) can be performed in parallel.**  By splitting up these calculations across CPUs or GPUs, this can give us significant gains in computational times.
